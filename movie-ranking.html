<h1>The Best Movies According to CK</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Godfather Part 1</h3>
<p>“The Godfather” is told entirely within a closed world. That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. 
The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. 
Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.</p>

<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but “The Shawshank Redemption” creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.
Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. “Shawshank” slows down and looks. It uses the narrator’s calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. 
It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>The movie’s copious needle drops drag us deeper into the decade, from Van Halen’s “Jump” and Twisted Sister’s “We’re Not Gonna Take It” to George Michael’s “Faith” and Tears for Fears’ 
Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” At times, the selections can be painfully on the nose; the use of New Order’s 
“Blue Monday” to set the tone as we enter a large, laser-filled dance club is absolutely perfect</p>
